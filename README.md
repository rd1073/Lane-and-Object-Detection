# Lane and Object Detection with YOLO and Hough Line Transform

This project combines two computer vision techniques: Lane Detection using Hough Line Transform and Object Detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once). It allows you to detect and annotate lanes and objects in videos.

## Features

- Lane Detection using Hough Line Transform
